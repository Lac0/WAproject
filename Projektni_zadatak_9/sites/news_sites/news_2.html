        <h2>Can this machine realy take such good photos?</h2>
        <p>
         The Fujifilm X-H2S is the company's most capable video/stills hybrid yet: a 26MP X-mount mirrorless camera built around a Stacked CMOS sensor.
        <p>
          The dynamic range also deserves a good word, it is great most of the time, boosted by the Auto HDR, but it never goes over the top. All photos exhibit high contrast, and there are some shadows a bit darker than we would have liked them, but this is nitpicking.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can shoot stills at up to 40fps (15fps with mechanical shutter), and capture full-sensor 6.2K video or 4K at up to 120 frames per second. As you'd expect, its autofocus has received a major boost, with subject-recognition and improved tracking.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we've seen on other recent high-end cameras, the adoption of a Stacked CMOS sensor comes with a significant speed boost for the camera's readout. In this instance it not only allows the camera to capture full-resolution images at up to 40 frames per second but also boosts how frequently the sensor can provide data for AF calculations.

        <h2>Prices of cameras up 20%.</h2>
        <p>
         It looks like it's not just energy bills that are going to cost more from 01 April. As much as we hoped it was a really bad April Fool's joke, several camera manufacturers including Canon, Nikon and Leica have told customers to expect price increases on their products. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While the price changes on some items won't be earth-shattering, if you’re looking to invest in a Leica Summilux M 28mm f/1.4 ASPH or a Canon EF 200-400mm f/4 L IS USM you’d be wise to invest now so you can save yourself $300 and $1,000 respectively (according to a report by Digital Camera Info and another by Leica Rumors). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Nikon Rumors first posted about potential price increases in February, after an email was sent to customers explaining why and when the increase will come into place: "We have experienced cost increases to component parts and logistic charges. 
        </p>
        <p>
         Whilst we have explored all options to absorb these costs, to maintain production on these lines moving forward, we are regrettably having to increase prices."
